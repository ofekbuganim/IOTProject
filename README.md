Group #: 8

## Details about the project
This project is a Smart Weather Station consisting of two units:
- An outdoor sensor unit that measures real-time environmental data: temperature, humidity, UV index, optionally wind speed, barometric pressure and altitude.
- An indoor display unit that shows data from the outdoor station, including indoor temperature and humidity.
 
## Folder description :
* Documentation: Problems we encounter and how we overcame them and connection diagram.
* ESP32: source code for the esp side (firmware).
* Unit Tests: tests for individual hardware components (input / output devices)
* flutter_app : dart code for our Flutter app.
* Milestones: We will track and document our project progress on a weekly basis.
