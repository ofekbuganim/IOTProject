## Details about the project
This project is a **Smart Weather Station** composed of multiple components working together to monitor and display environmental conditions in real time. The system consists of:

### 1. **Outdoor Sensor Unit (ESP32)**
- Measures real-time environmental data including:
  - üå°Ô∏è Temperature
  - üíß Humidity
  - üåû UV Index
  - üå¨Ô∏è Wind Speed 
  - üìà Barometric Pressure
  - üèîÔ∏è Altitude
- Sends the data wirelessly using **ESP-NOW** protocol to the indoor unit.

### 2. **Indoor Display Unit (ESP32)**
- Measures real-time environmental data including:
  - üå°Ô∏è Temperature
  - üíß Humidity
- Receives data from the outdoor unit.
- Displays the following on an LCD  touch screen (TFT):
  - Outdoor temperature, humidity, UV Index, Wind Speed, Barometric Pressure, Altitude 
  - Indoor temperature and humidity

### 3. **Mobile App (Flutter)**
- Developed using **Flutter** framework.
- Displays:
  - Real-time sensor data synced via **Firebase**
  - Graphs and charts of historical data
  - Weather forecast using external weather API
  - Customizable alert settings for UV, temperature, wind, humidity and water plant
- Syncs data with Firebase for storage and access.

### 4. **Firebase Cloud Backend**
- Stores all sensor readings for history and analysis.
